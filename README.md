# n-body-sim
javascript port of a simple n-body simulation used in me.3 (see repos)  
A simple implementation of an n-body simulation using Euler's method and Newtonian Laws of Gravitation. The use of more accurate ODE solvers, such as Runge Kutta would yield in result more similar to those observed in real life.
